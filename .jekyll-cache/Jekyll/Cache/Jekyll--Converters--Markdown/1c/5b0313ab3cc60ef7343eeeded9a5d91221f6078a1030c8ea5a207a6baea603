I"G<p>Software interrupts are synchronous interrupts. They are provided by almost all architectures as an instruction. It is generally used in the implementation of system calls. In the ARM ISA the instruction <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">svc</code> is used to invoke a software interrupt which causes the system to enter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">supervisor mode</code> and execute the vector routine for the same. Here i will provide a concise explanation of the software interrupt routine for the ARM v7 or ARM 32-bit architecture.</p>
